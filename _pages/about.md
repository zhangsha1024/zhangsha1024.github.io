I am a researcher at the Shanghai AI Laboratory, where I collaborate with a team on advanced AI research. Concurrently, I am a Ph.D. student at University of Science and Technology of China, working under the guidance of Yanyong Zhang on AI topics. I previously earned my B.E. degree from University of Science and Technology of China.

My research interests focus on building a capable super-intelligent system that can solve real-world perception, reasoning, understanding, and action problems. Given the difficulty of this goal, my current research primarily addresses the spatial intelligence: Enabling a general intelligence system to fully understand and interacte with the 3D world. I am still in the early stages of this long-term pursuit.
